# UK accidents case study


Introduction
The UK government amassed traffic data from 2016 and 2020, recording millions of accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.
Note that all the contained accident data comes from police reports, so this data does not include minor incidents.


Research Aim 
To find, analyse and evaluate trends in road accident data to suggest possible countermeasures to improve road safety in the UK through prevention or reduction of its impact.  
1.4 Research Objectives
The objectives of this dissertation are mainly the following:
1.	Gather a comprehensive database of road accident statistics for built up roads with factors that affect road safety which have been provided by the database.
2.	Analyse data for the factors, which can impact accident rates (e.g. light conditions, weather, road surface conditions, types of junctions etc.)
3.	Determine type of road classes with highest and lowest amount of accident rates from analysing tables of road accident statistics and charts created from the database (STATS19)



ACCIDENT REPORT FORM
For most purposes, the database needs to be able to answer the following questions:
•	Place of accident
•	Time of accident
•	Individuals involved
•	Results of collision
•	Environmental conditions at sight and time of accident
•	Cause of accident
